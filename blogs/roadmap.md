## 📌 User Types & Access Levels

### 🎓 Institute/University Users

- **Manage Profiles:** Add or update institutional profiles.
- **Placement Data Management:** Upload and manage placement records.
- **Access Insights:** View aggregated statistics for institutional analysis.

### 🏢 Corporate Users

- **Student Database Access:** Search and view student profiles (with privacy controls).
- **Post Opportunities:** Advertise vacancies directly on the platform.
- **Explore Institutions:** Browse university profiles for collaboration.

### 🔑 Admin Users

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Registration Process

1. **Separate Forms:** Different forms for institutions and corporates.
2. **Documentation Upload:** Submit necessary documents (e.g., licenses, registrations).
3. **Email Verification:** Validate user email addresses.
4. **Admin Approval:** Final activation after admin approval.

### Login Process

- **Secure Login:** Email and password authentication.
- **Enhanced Security:** Optional two-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Convenience:** "Remember Me" option for frequent users.
- **Recovery:** Password reset for account recovery.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Password Requirements

- **Complexity Rules:**
  - Minimum 8 characters.
  - Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **User Feedback:** Password strength indicator for real-time validation.

### Session Management

- Automatic session timeouts for inactive users.
- Limit on concurrent active sessions to prevent misuse.

### Additional Protections

- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent brute force attacks on login attempts.
- **IP-Based Blocking:** Detect and block suspicious activities.

## 👤 User Profile Management

### Profile Completion Requirements

- **Mandatory Information:** Basic details, contact info, and verified documentation.
- **Dynamic Profiles:** Allow users to edit profiles as needed within role permissions.

### Account Lifecycle

- **Updates:** Users can update their details at any time.
- **Deletion Requests:** Allow users to delete their accounts while complying with data retention policies.

## 🔧 Data Access Controls

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Permissions:** Define actions each user type can perform.
- **Granular Control:** Restrict access to sensitive data based on roles.

### Data Visibility Rules

- Protect sensitive information by applying access rules.
- Ensure only authorized users view restricted data.

### Audit Logging

- Track all sensitive operations:
  - **Data Updates**
  - **Admin Approvals**
  - **Profile Changes**
